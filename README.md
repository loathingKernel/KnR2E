# Possible solutions to KnR2E exercises

Each folder has its own README.md with information about the corresponding
exercise. All solutions try to use materials already covered as far in the book,
unless otherwise stated.

To build use:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```

Any input is welcome.
